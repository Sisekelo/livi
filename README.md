This is a project that explores the Whisper API by OpenAI.

Currently focusing on 2 languanges (Portuguese and Swahili), hope to expand in a bit.

Instructions:

1. Run via node
2. Create a credentials.js file that looks like the below. - Not added here for security reasons
   export const credentials =  {
        apiKey: 'xxxxxxxx',
        organization: 'xxxxxxxxx'
    }
